## A post about paragraph  

In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new **paragraph**, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at _paragraph breaks_, depending on the selected style.

  > How such documented are actually stored depends on the file format. For example, HTML uses the \<p tag as a paragraph container. In plaintext files, there are two common formats. Pre-formatted text will have a newline at the end of every physical line, and two newlines at the end of a paragraph, creating a blank line. An alternative is to only put newlines at the end of each paragraph, and leave word wrapping up to the application that displays or processes the text.
