It started :)

10 Jul 2014.
I try to write at least 4 articles per month, but in reality there
are more. Every article I'm trying to post to relevant posts in StackOverflow.
This works very well, I'm getting over 40% of traffic from SO.

20 Aug 2014.
Every blog post goes to the following resources, right
after its publication:

 * twitter
 * linkedin
 * google+
 * reddit
 * hacker news
 * digg
 * stumble upon

5 Sep 2014.
The blog was added to JavaCodeGeeks.com, as a guest
author. I've got some traffic from there, but unfortunately, most
of the readers comment right there, at JCG.

8 Sep 2014.
The blog was added to [BOTW.org](http://blogs.botw.org/Computers/Programming/).
I didn't get any traffic from them yet, even through this submission
was rather expensive ($270).

10 Sep 2014.
Submitted the blog to a bunch of directories (over 1000).
