A stand-up meeting (or simply "stand-up") is
a daily team-meeting held to provide a status update
to the team members (says [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)).
In the next few pages I'll try to explain why these meetings,
being so popular in software development teams, are **pure evil**.

I'm not saying that they can be done right or wrong. I'm not
trying to give advices about how to do them properly so that they
work. I'm saying, they should **not** happen, ever. Because they
not only "don't work", but they do very bad, even catastrophic,
things to your management process, being it agile or not.

In a nutshell, daily stand-up meetings encourage
developers to transfer responsibility from their own shoulders
to everybody's. And without personal responsibility people degrade,
no matter what Agile Manifesto says.

By the way, a very famous article
[Management Time: Who's Got the Monkey?](http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1)
was published in the Harvard Business Review about this very subject. The gist
of it is that a good manager should always delegate tasks to her people,
making them fully responsible for the result. And people always tend
to try to push responsibility back, to the manager's shoulders. The manager
should prevent this from happening. Daily stand-up meetings work against
the manager, by helping programmers to avoid being responsible for the
tasks they are assigned to.

So, first step. There is a sprint with a list of tasks to be done by
the team. Some of the tasks belong to Jeff, who is a Java programmer. He
knows what to do and he knows that the deadline is in five days.

In the morning, everybody, including Jeff, stay in front of each other,
talking in a round-robin mode. When it's time to talk for Jeff, he says
something like this:

> I was working with module A yesterday, it seems to be more
difficult than I expected. Today I'm going to work with it again.
Hopefully will be able to run it. No specific impediments besides that.

This is a very typical message, I've heard it thousands times in
SCRUM/Agile teams. What exactly Jeff is saying? He is saying something like
this:

> The problem with this module, I don't want to face it alone.
I want all of you to know that if I fail, it's not my fault. Don't
blame me, blame the module.
