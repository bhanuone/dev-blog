We work with many programmers [remotely](http://www.teamed.io/developer.html),
but we never do any business with software outsourcing companies. I'm getting
a few emails every day from them, offering "the best and the cheapest"
services in almost every area of software programming, and I always
have to say "no". This article summarizes our reasons of why
software outsourcing companies are useless, harmful,
and destructive for our development model, powered by
[XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org).

To be honest, over the last four years, I've tried to work with about a dozen
of software shops &mdash; all these attempts failed. Read on, here
is a summary of what went wrong and why.

## How They Work

Our model of work is strongly against any middle layers between us and programmers. We work only directly with those who write code. There is simply no need to have anyone between us. If you have a good programmer and can recommend him to us, we'll pay a finder's fee to you ($250), as soon as this programmer completes first 10 tasks with us.
