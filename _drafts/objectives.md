Who do you work for, your boss or your project? What is the difference?

It is kind of phylosophical question, but it has practical implications.

A traditional view defines three positions:

 me -> my boss -> the market

A project (or a business, a company, a venture) is what we do together
in order to change the world around us. We contribute with something
and we get some benefits from the world. We give and we take something
back.

I'm suggesting a different point of view: we're all one - the project.

The project must have a number of stakeholders and all of them have objectives.
The project will be successful if we manage to satisfy all objectives.

My objective is to make money
