  It is mission critical, in a software team, to
  define explicit vertical lines of subordination,
  to prevent... bad things

Holacracy for organizations, autocracy for projects!

This is the gist of the next few pages.

I stongly believe, and will try to convience you, that while
it is very effective to structure an organization in a democratic
and sociocratic way, a project should be managed in
a completely opposite approach.

A project should resemble a dictatorship, authoritarianism or a military hierarchy,
with a single strong result-oriented leader, giving explicit orders,
which are never doubted by subordinates.

## What Is The Difference?

Project vs Organization

## Story #1: Mr. Wolf

## Story #2:

I believe that modern organizations should be
as flat in their management structure as possible, avoiding
bureaucracy. I also believe that project they run should be
as much hierarcical

There are basically two different extremes in organizational structures:
flat and hierarcical. Both have their pros and cons, however flat structure
is a much more popular way to run a young software start-ups.

I'm totally in favor of a flat structure, since it removes unnecessary
beuracracy  , a flat structure means that, being a member of it,
you can't answer a simple question: who is your boss? Both in
technical and management perspectives.

If it's a technical solution you are introducing, you don't know
who exactly has a final say about its acceptance. In most cases,
you will have to go through a semi-democratic serie of discussions,
conviencing your peer programmers.

If it's a management decision, for example, about an appraisal of
your performance, you don't know exactly how it is measured and by who.
Most companies even practice group appraisals, where almost everybody
give you their kudos which build up a summary performance rating.

My experience tells me that an absence of explicit hierarcial
definition of roles and responsibilities turns a possibly productive
software team into a degraded and unmotivated mess. More generally
speaking, an absence of group rules is a huge danger.

Let me show a few stories happened with me and my friends over
the last few years. Also, I'll try to summarize each of them with
lessons learned.

Yeah, before
