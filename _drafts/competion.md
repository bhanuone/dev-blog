When your team is choosing which technical decision to make,
who has the final say? When one of your colleagues asks
for a raise, who decides and what his decision is based on?
When it's necessary to work overtime, how it's decided
who should stay in the office?

I'm expecting you to shrug shoulders. You're right, these questions never
have explicit answers in modern organizations. We are used to work
in a more democratic way, where such decisions are made
**subjectively**, but managers or just more senior employees.

We are trying to avoid explicity in these sensitive subjects. Indeed,
how can we tell one programmer that his salary is lower than the one
of his friend because his performance is worse?
This will definitely lead to depression and negativity
in the team, right?

What I'm trying to say is that **we don't set rules**. We think that
strict and explicit rules, related to their performance,
offend creative people. Well, all people.

We avoid explicity in performance appraisal.

This is a mistake and it causes big problems.

When a group doesn't have explicitly defined principles of
survival and growth, it starts to create them naturally. When
people don't know what exactly needs to be done in order to get
a 15% raise, they get this information anyway. Guess what
this information will be about? Right, you have to make your
boss happy and that's how your chances for a raise get higher.

Instead of working towards the goals set by the organization,
we are fighting with each other for the attention of our boss.
Instead of focusing on the results and their quality, we
are reading the mood of our manager. Our fear becomes a guide for us.

I can compare this with gladiators in ancient Rome. They were fighting
with each other without any rules, just to get a thumb from the
emperor. The absence of explicit appraisal mechanism turns us
into gladiators, fighting at the arena (the office).
